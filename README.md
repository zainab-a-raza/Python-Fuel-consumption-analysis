# Python-Fuel-consumption-analysis

This project focuses on the analysis of vehicular emissions, investigating the impact of various factors on emission levels. Through analysis and the development of a predictive model, the study aims to uncover patterns and dependencies among features such as engine size, vehicle type etc in relation to emissions. The predictive model is designed to accurately estimate emissions based on these factors, providing a valuable tool for understanding and managing vehicular emissions.
